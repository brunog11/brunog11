## Hi, my name is Bruno!

I graduated in Civil Engineering 👷🏗️ and practicing it since 2011, always applying technology 💻 in solving problems with the help of software 💾 and programming languages 🐍.

- Since I started studying engineering, I applied python script development to solve problems.
- In 2019 he began to study and research data science and web development to bring what he learned during those years to projects.
